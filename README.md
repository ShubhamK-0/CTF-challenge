# CTF-challenge
CTF Exploitation Breakdown form Recon to Root Shell.

This project involved conducting a complete penetration test on the Darkhole 2 virtual machine downloaded from VulnHub, simulating a real-world offensive security engagement. The objective was to identify, exploit, and document various security flaws in the target system.

We began with thorough network and service enumeration using tools like nmap. From there, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and exploitedâ€”ranging from Git repository leakage, SQL injection to privilege escalation. Each flaw was carefully analyzed with supporting proof-of-concept and risk assessment.

The exploited vulnerabilities were mapped to OWASP Top 10 (Web/API) standards and assigned CVSS scores. The findings were consolidated into a professional vulnerability report that includes mitigation strategies for each issue.

Throughout the project, tools such as Kali Linux and Burp Suite were used for exploitation and post-exploitation. The end result was complete system compromise, from initial foothold to root shell.

This assessment not only validated technical skills across the cyber kill chain but also emphasized the importance of secure development, access control, and configuration management.
